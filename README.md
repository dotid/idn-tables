# IDN Reference Tables
## Background
The IDN tables in this repository have been created to facilitate the IDN part of Pre-Delegation Testing for the ICANN's New gTLD program. A TLD created under that program may, if supported by the Registry Agreement, register IDNs as SLDs (second level domains). The agreement limits the support to specified languages or Unicode scripts.

The tables in this repository list allowed code points for a certain language or script and specify any necessary contextual rules. The tables have been created following "Guidelines for IDN Reference Tables" found in this repository. The tables are divided into two parts, Language tables and Script tables, respectively.

The tables available match the most frequent languages and scripts that have been up for Pre-Delegation Testing.

## Disclaimer
The intended use of the repository is for IDN labels. Any use beyond that is not supported.

## Use of tables
Anyone is free to use the IDN tables available in this repository for their own purposes.
